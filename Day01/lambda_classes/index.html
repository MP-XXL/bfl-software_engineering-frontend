        <p>
            Lambda is a deep tech venture studio within <a href="/">Ergodic Group</a>, a holding company<br> focused on long-term technology bets. We identify hard problems worth solving<br> and build advanced systems to solve them.<br><br>
            Our team brings deep expertise across cryptography, distributed systems, com-<br>pilers, machine learning, high-frequency trading, real-time bidding, aero-<br>space, biotech, gaming, and embedded devices. This domain knowledge—knowing<br> what to build and why—is our foundation.<br><br>

            We work where research meets production.<br><br>

            Founded in 2014 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Lambda has expanded to Montevideo<br> (Uruguay), Madrid and Barcelona (Spain), and Paris (France). We hire in all<br> locations.

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Technical Judgment at Scale</b><br>
            In a world where code is increasingly automated, the scarce resource is<br> judgment: knowing which problems matter, which architectures will hold, and which<br> tradeoffs are worth making. Lambda exists to apply deep technical judgment to<br> complex challenges.<br><br>
            <b>Our Engagement Model</b><br>
            We don't work hourly. We don't do staff augmentation.<br><br>
            We establish shared goals with our partners and work independently, employing<br> our methodology to achieve results. When you partner with Lambda, you're not<br> hiring developers—you're engaging a team that will own the problem end-to-end.<br><br>
            We ensure fluid communication and full accountability. But we work our way.<br> We've spent a decade learning how.

        <h2>Our values</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>No bullshit:</b> We prioritize results over rhetoric, substance over ceremony.</li>
                <li><b>Integrity:</b> We embrace openness and truthfulness. Honesty is the cornerstone of a strong community.</li>
                <li><b>Open source:</b> We believe in shared knowledge and collaboration. Our work is public by default.</li>
                <li><b>Less is more:</b> Do the simplest thing that could work. Stay agile, stay effective.</li>
                <li><b>Fail fast:</b> Setbacks are learning experiences. We embrace growth through failure.</li>

        <h2>Work with us</h2>
        <p>
            We believe in transparency: both our selection process and the foundational<br> year are demanding. They're designed to
            challenge you and help you grow.<br><br>
            
            60% of applicants do not complete the selection process. 50% of those who join<br> do not continue after the first year due
            to cultural, technical, or methodological<br> differences. We're selecting for people who can navigate ambiguity,<br> exercise
            judgment on hard problems, and thrive in an environment where the answer<br> isn't always clear.<br><br>

            <h5>Note: For the type of work we do, we think remote work is not particularly effective.</h5><br>
